Task:

Create variables to store the following numerical values:
- num_1 = 25
- num_2 = 10
Perform the following comparisons between num_1 and num_2, printing the result of each comparison:
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Equal to (==)
-Not equal to (!=)

Explanation: Comparison operators are used to evaluate relationships between values, resulting in either True or False.
